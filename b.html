        <center>Biden stands defiant on critical night - but gaffes mar fightback.</center>
    </h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        Joe Biden took to the stage at his Thursday night news conference with everything on the line – his presidency, his re-election hopes, his political life.
        <br>
        <br>
    If those were the stakes, he barely acknowledged them at the hour-long session to mark the end of a Nato summit, having earlier introduced Ukraine's President Zelensky as "President Putin" at a separate event.
    <br>
    <br>
    The news conference was his first unscripted appearance after a disastrous debate with his rival Donald Trump, leading to calls from several Democratic politicians and donors for him to drop out of the race for president.
    Mr Biden, 81, has faced continuous questions over his age and ability to serve another term, which intensified after the debate.
    <br>
    <br>
    But at the highly anticipated news conference, he dismissed the concerns about his campaign that were posed again and again by a room full of reporters, and promised that he was fighting not for his legacy, but to finish the job he started when he took office in 2021.
    “If I slow down and can’t get the job done, that’s a sign I shouldn’t be doing it,” he said. “But there’s no indication of that yet.”
    <br>
    <br>
    Depending on perspective, it was either a sign of dogged determination or of a man in denial about how dire his situation has become.
    Minutes after the news conference finished, several more Democratic members of Congress publicly called on Mr Biden to step down, joining at least a dozen other lawmakers in the president's own party who have done so.
    <br>
    <br>
    The question for Joe Biden's campaign is whether the floodgates will now open, or if the tide will hold.
    <br>
    The situation will not be helped by two excruciating gaffes that will be remembered by anyone who watched.
    In his very first answer, he called his own Vice-President Kamala Harris "Vice-President Trump" – a painful faceplant in front of a national television audience.
